## About Website
This is a personal blog for myself. As I wish to join a major airline in Taiwan as a cadet pilot upon graduation, this personal site will mainly feature my ongoing aviation studies aimed at a cadet pilot career. But also featuring some of the notes I've made throughout my Bachelor's degree. Besides these contents, there are also some scattered thoughts randomly on the "Thoughts" section.

## About Me
I am originally from Taiwan and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, China.
