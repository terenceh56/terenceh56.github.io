After today's graduation project works, I went for a jog. Before this, during dinner, I felt a bit lonely and decided to ask for someone on Yuquan Campus to talk with while eating. Asked some juniors from Taiwan, and I texted the one who was recommended by most of them. Shown in following picture.

Then, I received this picture after the jog.

I have no idea why I was so furious after seeing this, like, when I realised, I am also shocked by myself, why am I having such strong mood toward the juniors, I shouldn't act like this, I should just laugh and move on with my own things, which I am pretty confident I'll do. It's quite scary that how irritable I am now. Recorded for myself to think about it. It's clearly not the "Gay"s part that pissed me off, I'll do the same lol.
