## About

This is my lecture note on Applications of data analysis and machine learning. The lecture is given by two professors, Wang Wenguan and Pradeep Ravikumar.

The notes have been transcribed from a handwritten version, and their structure may be somewhat informal and selective, as I only recorded the points I considered essential. If you are interested in seeing the original handwritten document, please feel free to contact me.

Feedback is welcome for any corrections.
