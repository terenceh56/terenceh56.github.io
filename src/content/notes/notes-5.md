## About

This is my lecture note on Information Electronics Physics Fundamentals.

The notes have been transcribed from a Chinese handwritten version, and their structure may be somewhat informal and selective, as I only recorded the points I considered essential. If you are interested in seeing the original handwritten document, please feel free to contact me.

Feedback is welcome for any corrections.
