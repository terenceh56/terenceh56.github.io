## About

This is my lecture note on Information, Control and Computing.

The notes includes some part that wasn't mentioned on the lecture but in the coursebook, noted "Book-Only Content".

The notes have been transcribed from a handwritten version, and their structure may be somewhat informal and selective, as I only recorded the points I considered essential. If you are interested in seeing the original handwritten document, please feel free to contact me.

Feedback is welcome for any corrections.
